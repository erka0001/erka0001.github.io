        <p>My name is Bengu. This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of living in Canada. I moved to Canada with my two kids and
          my spouse. I have a 13 years old daughter and 6 years old son. I live in Ottawa. I am interested in web
          development. I would like to work as a <em>Web Developer</em> once I complete my program.
        </p>
        <P>I graduated with an Industrial Engineering degree. I have 13 years of experience working as an <abbr
            title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> Business Analyst in banking industry. I decided to build a new
          career while building a new life in a new country. I would like to have a chance to gain new skills that I
          have not tried before. Therefore, I am in Interactive Media Design Program.</P>
